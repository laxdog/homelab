# Home Assistant

Source of truth:
- `config/homelab.yaml` -> `services.vms.home-assistant`, `home_assistant`
- `ansible/secrets.yml` -> `home_assistant_admin_password`

## Bootstrap behavior
- HAOS VM is provisioned by Terraform.
- HAOS disk image is imported only when the target VM disk has no partition table
  (prevents destructive re-image on repeated applies).
- During `scripts/run.py guests`, role `home-assistant-bootstrap` checks `/api/onboarding`.
- If onboarding is not complete, it creates the initial owner user via API.
- The same role also completes onboarding steps from `config/homelab.yaml`:
  - `core_config` (location, coordinates, elevation, units, timezone, currency)
  - `analytics` (enabled/disabled)
  - `integration`
- If onboarding is already complete, no onboarding data is changed.
